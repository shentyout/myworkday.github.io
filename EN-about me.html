								<h2>Experience as a UI/UX Designer<br />
							</header>
							<p>In Two-Shoulder  I am involved in the development of smart agriculture and smart manufacturing systems. My main responsibilities include researching user workflows and designing interfaces. 
							In the pre-development phase, I conduct user interviews and analyze existing systems and apps in the market to better understand users' work habits.
							After simulating different usage scenarios and making necessary adjustments, I reconstruct the user workflow and discuss its feasibility with the frontend and backend engineers. 
							I propose reasonable improvement solutions and proceed with the system interface design.</br>
							In the middle of the development phase, I continue to talk to different users and design interfaces that are suitable for different groups of people based on their age and preferences. 
							I ensure that the interfaces are easy to understand and free of any cognitive misunderstandings that could arise during the product use. 
							I also give feedback to the engineers on what they need to improve to make the product easier and more enjoyable to use.</br>
							After the system development, we move on to testing. I keep track of any inconvenience or mistakes made by users and work to improve them. 
							I continue to gather feedback through interviews and follow up, doing everything possible to make the product as perfect as it can be.

							<h2>Experience as a Baby product Designer</h2>
						</header>
						<p>This company has helped me become a project designer who can independently manage the entire development process and production schedule!</p>
							<p>
							In the early stages, I led design assistants to conduct market analysis, purchase and test products from other brands, analyze and test the results, then propose sketches or 3D modeling solutions.<br />
							During development, we designed and tested the product's structure for safety, which was a challenging process for designers due to a high failure rate, and confirm whether the design can be mass-produced.<br />
							I need to confirm the mold-making method, cost, time, and schedule of test mold.<br/>
							The repeated testing and modification phase, we send test products to the quality control department and national laboratory for experiments, and provide feedback to our design team. Finally, we arrange for product mass production, control the production line schedule, and conduct packaging experiments.。<br />
							Developing a product is complicated and requires coordination with various departments. It needs patience and good communication skills. Fortunately, I have experience in mold development and the ability to handle challenges professionally. Despite the complexity, I managed to complete the project and task successfully.</p>

							<h2>Experience as a Mold Designer</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							This company mainly focuses on mold design for Japanese cosmetics and automotive parts.
						</p>
						<p>
							I was responsible for basic tasks such as drawing, producing and modifying drawings, liaising with manufacturers during the initial stages of this company.</br>
							After gaining enough experience, I started to participate in mold design. When facing different products, I need to discuss reasonable mold-making methods with customers, consult with engineers on processing techniques, and also arrange schedules and locations for mold testing.</br>
							Later on, I was responsible for handling mold flow analysis and quality control. I needed to discuss with customers about the gating method, gating points, number and sequence of gating. By using Moldex3D analysis, I would discuss the injection conditions with the injection molding engineers, verify the rationality of the mold flow, and write a report.
						</p>
						<p>
							This company's experience has made me a designer capable of solving unexpected situations.
