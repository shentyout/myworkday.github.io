					<h2>Carry the entire aquaculture farm</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					We have a smart farming website, but it's not practical for busy fishermen to input feeding records on a computer. So we made a simple app for them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Based on user feedback, we simplified necessary functions such as aquaculture operations and environmental input into the app. 
					and, complicated features such as cost calculation and report output still require on the computer.
					In past, records were kept on paper or input into a computer based on memory after the work. However, people tend to be lazy, they often forget or don't enter the forms on time.
					The app is designed to reduce the time spent sitting in front of the computer after work. 
					That's why I limited all the actions within a maximum of six steps, in order to minimize any unpleasantness caused by overly complicated processes.
				</p>
				<h4><strong>Our partners</strong></h4>
				<p>
					We have an excellent product manager, a imaginative UI/UX designer, a humorous app engineer, and a logical and meticulous back-end engineer.<br>
					As a UI/UX designer, I'm responsible for conducting user interviews, designing user flows, creating interfaces, conducting usability testing, and gathering feedback.

					<h2>The scope of usage and limitations of an app</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					The app version simplifies the operation by separating important features from various tabs in the web version, users can easily access their desired features without navigating through complex menus and submenus, as required in the web.
					The focus of the app is on efficiency, especially when working on the water. Users will try to avoid use of electronic devices as much as possible. According to market research, most fishmans use the Android. The main reasons are cheap and compatibility. 
					Therefore, we prioritize developing the app for Android.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Our strong point is that we work together in laboratories, and the biggest problem we face in the 21st century is controlling diseases.

								Integrate user feedback from the web to simplify operations as much as possible.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our biggest challenge is convincing elderly users, ranging from 40 to 80 years old, to use technology such as smartphones and apps, as they may only use their phones for calls and not even have LINE app, 
								We taught them some classes on using mobile phones and computers, which also showed us the age gap and business opportunities in the farming industry. Now, technology has solved many environmental problems. 
								Based on this, applying agricultural technology and implementing it will be a vast market.
							</p>
							<p>
								Users say it most troublesome that they have to input their daily farming records after a long day of work.Most of them write down their records on paper first and ask younger colleagues or children to help input them. 
								However, there is a risk of errors or no implementation when information is relayed through intermediaries.
								Therefore, with the feasible technology available, we will develop the system into an app to simplify the process and reduce the frustration of older users.
							</p>
							<p>	
								Web version had up to 8 steps, but we simplified it to 6 steps to increase efficiency.

					We keep updating the breeding data of different species and building up information, uploading the environmental data and farmers' experience to a shared cloud platform.

				<p>
					Farmers usually use their experience to handle unexpected situations, without organizing information or streamlining operations. 
					They also tend to avoid using electronic devices and trust their habits than computer. We go to the fishing fields, experience the work ourselves, and turn those experiences into our product.
