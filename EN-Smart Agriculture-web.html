				</header>
				<p>
					There's no full fish farming monitoring system available now. We offer water quality checking and digital fish farming records with cost reports to manage everything better and save time.</br>
				</p>
				<p>
					We combine devices that monitor water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity, and water level in real-time. Also, we partner with a lab that tests for ammonia, nitrite, and bacteria. 
					This helps farmers see how the water is doing and fix problems quickly. Plus, we have a system to track feed expenses, which helps farmers manage their farms better.
				</p>
				<h4><strong>Our partners</strong></h4>
				<p>
					We have an excellent product manager, a imaginative UI/UX designer, flexible front-end Engineer, and a logical and meticulous back-end engineer.<br>
					As a UI/UX designer, I am responsible for conducting user interviews, designing user flows, creating interfaces, conducting usability testing, and gathering feedback.

					<h2>System Service & Scope</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					There are two major companies in Taiwan that specialize in IoT aquaculture farming. They have developed mature and accurate water quality sensing devices.
					Our system goal and service is to use their technology to advance further, which is <font color="#FFB000">Culture monitoring + Culture record (cost statistics) = Aquaculture traceability.</font>
				</p>
				<p>	
					We combined three things into a system following aquaculture procedures. Our goal is to make it easier for people to use and give them confidence.

								<h2>User interview<h2></h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								Our audience is small and medium fish farmers. Young people are leaving farming, and we will have harsh weather and food shortages in the future. The farming system is not organized and needs to be improved.
							</p>
							<p>
								We are helping three farms raise shrimp and fish using better technology. The workers are mostly men over 50 years old, who have trouble with digital media and their physical abilities are getting worse. 
								They can't use electronics while working in the fishponds and don't like complicated instructions. They work at odd hours, like in the middle of the night. So the farms want to use new technology to monitor, give feedback, and feed the animals remotely.<br />
								<br />
								Our system helps us manage daily tasks for raising aquatic animals, such as updating batches, feeding, measuring growth, harvesting, and packaging. We also keep track of water intake, disinfection, and pond management for a clear overview of our aquaculture operation.
							</p>
							<p>
								We are improving our processes and creating an alarm system based on environmental data for each species. We also track batch statistics for comprehensive and transparent data.

					<h2>Promoting small farmers</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					In recent years, facing environmental crises such as global climate change and food shortages, people have begun to address the issues of agriculture and the agricultural population. 
					The rapid development of 5G, shared cloud, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things has also brought new opportunities for smart agriculture.
				</p>
				<p>
					Farmers used to rely on their experience to deal with unexpected situations, but now technology allows them to digitize farming processes. With the development of shared cloud technology,
					 smart agricultural products are emerging on the market, each with its own advantages, but lacking effective integration.We are working with the agricultural committee to promote smart farming to small farmers based on this standard. 
					 We hope to upload farming data to an agricultural cloud for future data training.
				</p>
				<p>
					We're gathering data about how different fishs and shirmps grow, and improving our sensors to make sure they work better. We're also learning from farmers. We hope that soon, 
					there will be lots of smart farms in Taiwan, and that more young people will want to come back and make money from them.
